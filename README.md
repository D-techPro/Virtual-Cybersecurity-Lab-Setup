# Virtual Cybersecurity Lab-Setup

**1.	Introduction**
Ethical hacking requires a safe and isolated environment to practice and test vulnerabilities without risking real systems. A virtual lab provides this isolation, allowing users to sharpen their skills and learn from mistakes without causing harm.

**2.	Essential Components** 
To set up a virtual cybersecurity lab, I made use of three main components:  
•	Virtualization Software (VirtualBox): This software allows a single physical computer (host) to run multiple virtual machines (VMs). Each VM acts as a separate computer with its own operating system. In this project I used two virtual machines with Kali Linux and windows 7 as the operating systems.
•	Attacking Machine (VM): This VM is used to perform penetration testing and vulnerability assessments. Kali Linux OS is used as it come pre-installed with a wide array of cybersecurity tools
•	Target Machine (VM): This VM is the system that will be attacked and analyzed. I made use of windows 7 OS for this project.

**3.	Installation Process**
**Install VirtualBox**
I downloaded and install VirtualBox from its official website. I ensured I also download and install the VirtualBox Extension Pack.

**Install Attacking Machine** (Kali Linux) 
I downloaded the VirtualBox image for Kali Linux OS iso file. uploaded the downloaded iso file into logical optical anchor of the storage section in the virtual machine.
